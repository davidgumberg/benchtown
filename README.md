This is a static-site-generator based on
[bridgetown](https://github.com/bridgetownrb/bridgetown) (jekyll fork). It
serves as a frontend for an experimental tool for performing long running benchmarks of Bitcoin Core, found at https://github.com/bitcoin-dev-tools/benchcoin

## Project Structure

The vast majority of the files and folders here are boilerplate / scaffolding,
so I want to highlight what I think are the relevant parts:

The logic that handles construction of
["resources"](https://www.bridgetownrb.com/docs/resources) (every PR and run
is a 'resource') from the data generated by benchcoin is in
`plugins/builder/pull_requests_builder.rb`.

All that is important that remains is the templating and components for the
views that we generate and is all located in `src/`.  For toplevel pages like
the indexes of `runs` and `pulls`, an ERB template file is placed in
`/src/`. 

### View Abstractions

The layouts used to render individual resources are located in `/src/_layouts`,
and there are ~two~ three competing abstractions for making views "modular"/DRY: 
'layouts', 'partials' and "components".

Start with layout, if a part of the layout becomes too complicated or is worth
reusing make it a component.

#### Partials 
Avoid using 'partials' (`/src/_partials`) entirely, in theory, partials should
be used as a sort of "dumb" component that doesn't require any logic and is
pure document content that you want to insert in another document, but in
practice this is rare and overlaps with layouts too much.


#### Layouts
Layouts, in `/src/_layouts` are jekyll/bridgetown's homegrown abstraction, these seem
to be inverted partials. Where, e.g. instead of including the header
partial at the top and the footer partial at the bottom of your document, you
write a layout that has a header and footer with a `<% yield %>` clause in the middle,
and mark your document as a user of that layout, and it's contents will be
inserted at the yield statement.

Because we are generating fake resources with the resource builder, we are
kind-of forced into using layouts as the view of individual resources we
generate.

#### Components
Components are partials that you can pass variables[^1] and that can process
them before handing things off to a layout file. Each component consists of a
`component.erb` template that gets included when you `render` the component in a
document, and a `component.rb` file that defines a subclass[^2] of
`Bridgetown::Component` with an `initialize` method that takes the arguments
passed in the `render` call and sets up the instance variables (`@var`) that
will be available in the template.

Using Bridgetown components at present because there was some trouble getting
Gtihub's ViewComponents to work, but for most use cases they are basically
identical.

[^1]: Partials can do this too, but components are much, much better
[^2]: According to [Zeitwerk](https://github.com/fxn/zeitwerk) rules, it's based on the directory layout, i.e.
    `src/_components/foldername/filename.rb` will need to define: `class
    Foldername:Filename < Bridgetown::Component`. look at the
    existing examples.


### Where benchcoin generated data goes

In the future, this could be an API, but I don't know what shape that should
take.

The `PullRequestBuilder` expects there to be a folder `src/benchcoin`: with the
following layout:

```
📂src/benchcoin
    - 📂pr-1
        - 📂{{github-run-id}}
            - [ ...results generated by bitcoin-dev-tools/benchcoin... ]
    - 📁pr-2
    - [....]
    - 📂pr-{{pr-number}}
        - 📁{{github-run-id}}
        - 📁{{github-run-id}}
        - 📁{{github-run-id}}
        - 📁{{github-run-id}}
```

Currently, the layout of `src/benchcoin` is identical to the `results`
[folder](https://github.com/bitcoin-dev-tools/benchcoin/tree/gh-pages/results)
of the `gh-pages` [branch](https://github.com/bitcoin-dev-tools/benchcoin/tree/gh-pages) of
bitcoin-dev-tools/benchcoin.

More details can be found in this repo's gh-pages script
(`.github/workflows/gh-pages.yml`) this repo uses to
generate the Github pages hosted instance, I will move this script to a justfile
to simplify local development.

### ERB 

[ERB](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.3/ERB.html) is a templating system for
mixing Ruby expressions with arbitrary plain text documents, where anything
inside of `<% %>` gets evaluated silently, and the result or return value of
evaluating the expression inside of `<%= %>` is inserted into the document.

Control-flow applies outside of the ruby expressions, e.g.:

```erb
# `index.erb`
<% if true %>
    <h1>The statement was true!</h1>
<% else %>
    <h1>The statement was false!</h1>
<% end %>
```

would generate the html file:

```html
# `index.html`
<h1>The statement was true!</h1>
```

#### Why Bridgetown?

Bridgetown serves as a nice middle ground between hand rolling github
actions scripts for generating HTML from benchmark results and a full web-app framework like
Ruby on Rails, it even uses a lot of the same abstractions and libraries as Ruby
on Rails, like erb templates and Github's ViewComponent library, meaning that if
something more full-fat is ever needed, a lot of what's here could be reused.
