Most of the files and folders here are boilerplate / scaffolding, so here is a
quick tour of the relevant parts:

The logic that handles construction of "resources" (every PR and run
is a 'resource') from the data generated by benchcoin is in
`plugins/builder/pull_requests_builder.rb`.

Almost all of the important stuff left is in `src/`.  For toplevel pages like
the index of `runs` and of `pulls`, an HTML-ERB template file is just placed in
`/src/`. 

ERB is a templating syntax for ruby, where anything inside of `<% %>` gets
evaluated silently, and the result or return value of evaluating the expression
inside of `<%= %>` is inserted into the document.

Control-flow applies outside of the ruby expressions, e.g.:

```erb
# `index.erb`
<% if true %>
    <h1>The statement was true!</h1>
<% else %>
    <h1>The statement was false!</h1>
<% end %>
```

would generate the html file:

```html
# `index.html`
<h1>The statement was true!</h1>
```

The layouts used to render individual resources are located in `/src/_layouts`,
and there are ~two~ three competing abstractions for creating reusable pages,
"layouts", "partials" and "components". Avoid using `partials` entirely, and start
with the layout, if it gets too complicated or you need to reuse it in more than
one layout, then make it a component.
